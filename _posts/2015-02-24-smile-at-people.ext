		<p>We may be inclined to dismiss an idea when it is both simple and confronting. Smiling at people can be confronting.</p>

<p>We might ask:
Will my smile be genuine at first? Does it
matter?
What if people donâ€™t understand and react
negatively?
What if people DO understand and react
negatively?
</p>
<p>
We might also ask:
What if I create a whole new set of experiences
by changing my expression?
What if I set in motion a whole new set of
interactions by changing my expression?
