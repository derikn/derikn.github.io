We may be inclined to dismiss an idea when it is both simple and confronting. Smiling at people can be confronting.

We might ask:
Will my smile be genuine at first? Does it
matter?
What if people donâ€™t understand and react
negatively?
What if people DO understand and react
negatively?

We might also ask:
What if I create a whole new set of experiences
by changing my expression?
What if I set in motion a whole new set of
interactions by changing my expression?
