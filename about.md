Stepping Sideways is a deck of cards designed to help us break out of mental habits and physical routines - habits and routines which may be invisible to us and which may reinforce our isolation and stuck-ness. We use the cards when we want to manifest new outcomes in our urban environments.

The phrases on the cards point to actions, attitudes or perspectives that we should be able to adopt immediately and incorporate into our day without extensive pre-planning. We draw a single card from the shuffled pack. The card is trusted for the entire day, even if its appropriateness is quite unclear...

The strategies on these cards are not based on peer-reviewed social science. They make no claim to affecting any one particular new outcome. They are intuitively-authored aphorisms. They are open to interpretation. They disrupt rather than perscribe.

Stepping Sideways is indebted to and modeled on "Oblique Strategies" - a deck of printed cards in a black container box created by musicians Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. Each card offers a phrase or cryptic remark intended to help artists break creative blocks by encouraging lateral thinking. (Source - Wikipedia)

Stepping Sideways aspires to become a free downloadable, print-able deck, an interactive website and a phone app. Please explore this prototype deck. Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Speak to or email John Woods at john.woods@gobaci.com
