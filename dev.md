In addition to Linguistics, Computer Science was my other  discipline and interest. Independent study saw me through to be familiar with regular web technologies such as WordPress, Jquery, Django and Git.

With Udacity's [Web Development Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253) (highly recommended), I built on tools such as Google App Engine, Google Datastore and classic HTML and CSS.
