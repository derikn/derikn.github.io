I studied Linguistics at Simon Fraser University and currently work as an independent researcher to [John Alderete](https://www.anderei.com). Our work focuses on the documentation and grammar construction of various low-resource languages. I have worked on grammars and dictionaries for Austronesian languages like Fijian and Athabaskan languages like Tahltan.
